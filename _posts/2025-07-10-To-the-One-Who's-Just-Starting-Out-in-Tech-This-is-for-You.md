# Dear Prospective or New Learner,
![2206_w023_n003_2519b_p1_2519](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/684d43d9-4d4b-45ae-8c91-6163d257f73e)


It might sound cliché, and yes, my eye is twitching as I say this, but I’ll still say it anyway: **“I know how you feel.”**

Starting something new can be daunting and overwhelming. I know that feeling — the one where you've doubted yourself a hundred times before finally deciding to upskill or learn something new. You’re not alone.

Most of us grew up believing that education only happens within the four walls of a classroom. That’s all we were taught. But look around. The world has changed, and it’s still changing. You have to be intentional about not staying stagnant and letting the world pass you by.

If you’re thinking about pivoting into tech, I won’t sugarcoat it. It’s a long and rewarding journey. There will be moments when it feels awkward, and you’ll question what the essence of it all is.
But that’s okay. It’s human to feel that way. What matters is what you do with those feelings. That is what will shape your story.

I remember feeling so lost during my first few weeks. I would literally go hysterical and ask myself what the whole point was. There was a day I shut my laptop and didn’t touch it for weeks, all because I made a mistake and got stuck. Looking back now, I realize those mistakes were necessary. They taught me something. But I also know now that it would’ve been so much easier to manage if I had a community to run to.

Every expert, tutor or mentor you see today once started as a novice. They took it one step at a time, from "Hello World" and beyond. You can do it too.

I once asked a learner, *“So, you studied finance, right?”*
She laughed and said, *“No, it’s Human Physiology.”*
I was stunned. I mean, how does someone who studied all those heavy medical concepts decide to start all over and take on data analysis with so much determination? But that’s the beauty of this journey. Anyone can start over and thrive.

As a beginner, it’s important to hold on to your goal. The end might seem blurry now, but trust me, you’ll see results. Maybe not as fast as you’d like, or maybe even faster than you imagined. Either way, every small decision you make now will shape your future, no matter how little it seems.

Here at Dotcampus, we’re building something different. A community where you can thrive in your tech career. We have mentors who are eager and committed to making sure this learning journey isn’t scary. They’ll walk with you, guide you, and support you.

To our prospective learners, I know there are many options out there. But give Dotcampus a shot. And to our new learners, welcome to the tribe. You belong here.
