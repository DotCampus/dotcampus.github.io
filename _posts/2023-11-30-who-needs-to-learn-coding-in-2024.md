## **Introduction**

The career landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by rapid technological advancements. Among the various skills that have emerged as pivotal in this tech-driven era, coding stands out as a key asset, shaping the trajectory of careers across STEM disciplines and beyond.

Recently, I wrote a post on LinkedIn about how the world is changing in 2023.  How coding skills are becoming increasingly important. Even if coding is not a core requirement for a job, people who possess the ability to write or understand code have an edge over those who do not.

In this follow-up article, I will try to answer questions like: Who needs to learn coding skills? Should I learn to code or not? How do I go about learning coding? And so on.

## The Changing Career Landscape

The boundaries between different professions, especially in STEM, are being blurred by coding. Whether it's data science or engineering, coding is now recognised as a fundamental skill. With more and more things being connected and distributed through the internet, and with technology becoming more integrated into people's lives, the silos that once limited coding to developers and engineers are being dismantled. People from unexpected domains like psychology, accounting, journalism, and other areas are now writing code to meet the demands of their jobs.

In this dynamic environment, embracing **lifelong learning** is not just an option but a necessity. Continuous adaptation to evolving technologies ensures sustained career development and growth. Learning to code is not a one-time endeavour but a journey of ongoing skill development that keeps professionals relevant in a constantly evolving landscape.

## Who Needs to Learn Coding Skills?

The answer is simple: everyone. As you must have noticed by now, coding is not exclusive to computer scientists or software engineers. Professionals in diverse fields, from biology to finance, can benefit from understanding the basics of coding. The logic is simple, since we use computers and computer-enabled technologies so often in our lives and work, does it not also make sense for us to learn to speak the language that computers understand?
Also, coding enhances problem-solving abilities, fosters a computational mindset, and opens new avenues for innovation.

## Common Misconceptions About Learning to Code

Despite the growing importance of coding skills, some common misconceptions are still barriers for many people trying to start learning to code. Contrary to popular belief, coding isn't exclusive to math prodigies. You do not need a computer science degree, as coding welcomes self-taught enthusiasts from various backgrounds, including arts and social sciences. Age is not a barrier, starting early isn't mandatory, and it is not for only young people. Memorisation is not the focus; understanding logic and problem-solving take precedence. Additionally, coding is not just about typing lines of code; it encompasses creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Lastly, coding isn't confined to tech enthusiasts; it's a skill that can be learned and applied by anyone with an interest in technology.

## The Role of Mentorship in Learning Coding

Mentorship plays a pivotal role in the journey of learning to code. If you are considering learning coding, leverage seasoned coders to gain valuable insights, learn from their experiences, and support. Mentorship programmes like Dot Campus mentorship create a collaborative learning environment, fostering a sense of community among aspiring coders.

## Conclusion

As the career landscape continues to evolve, the importance of coding skills remains unwavering. Embracing coding as a lifelong learning journey, dispelling misconceptions, and embracing mentorship are key steps toward navigating and thriving in the ever-changing tech-driven era. If you got nothing else from this article, get this: whether you are a seasoned professional or just starting, learning to code is an investment that pays dividends throughout your career.
