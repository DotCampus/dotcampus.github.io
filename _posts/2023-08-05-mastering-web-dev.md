## Introduction

Since I started mentoring and guiding people in their quest to learn software engineering, I have encountered a lot of people at different stages in the learning journey, and I have learnt to tailor the support I give to each person according to where they are in their journey. But whenever I meet an absolute beginner (someone with zero experience), I do the exact same thing every time - introduce them to web development.

The truth is, in today's digital age, web development has become an essential skill that can open up a plethora of opportunities for anybody seeking a career in the tech industry. Web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites, web applications, and other digital products. So I always ensure that my learners learn the skills at the earliest stage of their learning journey. By showcasing their ability to acquire web development skills, such a person, positions themselves more favourably to delve further into software engineering.

## Why Web Development?

Web development holds the key to unlocking boundless opportunities in the ever-evolving tech industry. It stands as the bedrock, the very essence that breathes life into the digital landscape, empowering us to create and maintain dynamic websites and cutting-edge web applications that shape our modern world. In today's interconnected reality, the web is not just a convenience; it has become an indispensable part of our daily lives, transcending borders and cultures to connect people, businesses, and ideas on a global scale. I firmly believe that anyone aspiring to build, design, or manage computer software products should not only recognise the significance of the web but embrace the intricate technologies that fuel its magic.

## Mastering web development

Mastering web development requires a combination of technical skills and
creativity. I usually get my learners started by making sure that they understand how
computers work, where in we typically answer questions around: how data is
processed, how software interacts with hardware, how information is transmitted across networks, and what web protocols are (HTTP, HTTPS,
UDP, FTP, etc). This foundational knowledge serves as the stepping stone for
exploring more advanced concepts in programming and technology. It is after this that the learner dives into the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic data-structures and algorithms which are the building blocks of the web. More advanced topics such as web frameworks, databases, and server-side scripting languages come much later after the learner had demonstrated their web skills by developing their own portfolio website or something similar as the capstone project.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, mastering web development can provide individuals with a gateway to the tech world, offering numerous career opportunities and a chance to make a positive impact on the digital landscape. By learning the necessary technical skills and staying up-to-date with the latest trends, you can establish yourself as experts and contribute to the development of innovative digital products. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, web development is a skill that can take your career to new heights.
