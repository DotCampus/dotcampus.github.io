# 4 Things to Consider Before Choosing a Tech Career Path (in 2025)

I have become accustomed to people interested in learning and starting a career in tech reaching out and asking questions about what they should learn. If you're confused too, then here are four key things to consider before diving into tech.

### 1. Start with “Why”

When I began learning Oracle Database Management in 2012, I didn’t have a strong “why”. I had no convictions about what I was going to do with the knowledge and skills that I gained. I copied notes and practiced little because my “why” was shallow. When I came back to learning tech in 2016/2017, I had a better “why”, and a plan with a timeline. I learned better and went further and eventually got my first tech role with Andela in 2018.

As Simon Sinek wisely noted, "Start with Why." Why do you want to learn tech? Be honest with yourself. There are countless reasons for wanting to acquire tech skills: it could be "to earn a good salary," "to do meaningful work and enjoy a comfortable life," "to start my own company," or "to future-proof my career." Whatever your reason may be, ensure that it resonates with you and is strong enough to sustain you through challenging times. Additionally, consider writing it down in your diary so you can always refer back to it.

### 2. Consider Where You Are Currently

If you are a student or fresh out of school, this may not matter much to you. However, if you have already started working and have more than 2 years of experience in your current career, then you need to consider it. If the career is not really what you have always wanted to do with your life, then feel free to put it in the trash and go for the tech skill of your dreams.

On the other hand, if you’re in the career you’ve always desired but are facing a mismatch between your expectations and reality, you’ll have a difficult decision to make. Learning a tech skill means that once you finish your training, you’ll likely start at the entry-level again. If starting over would be a deal-breaker for you, it might be wise to learn a tech skill that enhances your current job. For example, if you work with data a lot, like an accountant or clerk, consider learning data analytics to take your skills to the next level and help you grow in your current role faster, and so on.

If the prospect of starting from the bottom again is a risk you’re willing to take, then you know what to do!

### 3. Consider the Availability of Entry Level Opportunities

Before you make up your mind about what tech skill to go for, consider the availability of entry-level roles. A quick LinkedIn search for the tech skills under your radar will show you whether you are going to need normal luck or the Blessed Virgin Mary on your side to get an entry role.
The truth is that it is always difficult to find entry-level tech roles generally, especially from big companies. Many people I know start out freelancing, working for start-ups, and paying their dues - which typically involves very low pay with a huge workload. You need to be realistic with your expectations too. You are not Linus Torvalds, so you will likely need to pay your dues too before you start making the big bucks (even Linus paid his dues).

### 4. Consider the Growth Prospects of the Tech Role

Forget the hype you've seen and heard; many jobs and tech opportunities have been significantly impacted by AI. Mark Zuckerberg recently commented on how AI has been used to replace junior software developers at Meta, expressing that the company will target mid-level developer positions in 2025. This is the reality we face.

According to the World Economic Forum’s  Future of Jobs report (2025 - 2030), the tech industry is increasingly demanding AI and machine learning specialists, data analysts and scientists, big data analysts, and cybersecurity experts. While software engineering roles remain in demand, they are primarily sought after in emerging markets such as Africa. Think about that for a second.

In conclusion, don’t be like I was in 2012 - learning without a clear plan or purpose. Although my efforts eventually paid off, it's important to recognize that not all learning paths are equally valuable. If you're on a budget and time is limited, acquiring tech skills without direction can become an expensive luxury. Therefore, start by considering these four key factors and having a healthy “Why” in your learning journey.
