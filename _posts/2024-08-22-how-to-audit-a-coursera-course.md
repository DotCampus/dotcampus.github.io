If you don't have a Coursera account yet, then take a moment to create one. If you already have an account, then you can go ahead and log in.

## Disadvantages of Auditing a Course
1. You will not get a certificate after going through the course content
2. You will not be able to take some of the course quizzes and assessment
3. Your assignments will not be graded.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, auditing a course allows you to access the course content without needing to pay for it. However, if you are interested in the certificate also but you cannot afford it, then consider applying for "financial aid"
