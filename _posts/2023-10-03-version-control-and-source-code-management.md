# Demystifying Version Control and Source Code Management

## Introduction

If you've just started your journey into the world of software development, you might have come across terms like "Version Control" and "Source Code Management" (SCM). These concepts can seem daunting at first, but fear not! In this beginner-friendly guide, we'll demystify these terms, explain their importance, and show you how they can be your best allies in the world of coding. Letâ€™s go!

## Chapter 1: Understanding the Basics

*What is Version Control?*

Imagine you're working on a group project, like writing a book with your friends. Each of you has a copy of the book on your computer, and you make changes to your own copies. As time goes on, you realise that your friend's edits are better than yours, so you want to use their version. But how do you make sure you don't lose your own changes?

This is where version control comes in, and it's like having a magical book that keeps track of every change made by you and your friends.

1. **Snapshots of Your Book:** Version control takes snapshots of your book at different points in time. It's like taking photos of your book's pages as you work on it. You can always go back and look at these snapshots.
2. **Changes Are Tracked:** Every time you or your friends make a change to the book, version control keeps track of it. It knows who made the change and when. So, if you want to see what was added, removed, or modified, you can easily find out.
3. **Merge and Collaborate:** Let's say you and your friends worked on different chapters of the book simultaneously. Version control helps you combine all those changes into one final book. It's like putting together a puzzle with everyone's contributions.
4. **No Fear of Mistakes:** If you make a mistake while editing your book, version control can undo it, just like a magical eraser. So, you can experiment and be creative without worrying about messing up.
5. **Safe Storage:** Your book is stored in a secure place, like a vault. This means even if your computer crashes, you won't lose your book, because it's backed up in multiple locations.
6. **Collaborate Anywhere:** Version control lets you and your friends work on the book from anywhere in the world. It's like having a virtual writing room that's always open.

In the tech world, developers use version control to build software together, just like co-authors write a book. It helps them keep track of changes, collaborate effectively, and create amazing projects. So, version control isn't just for books; it's a superpower for collaboration in the digital age!

By using version control, developers can confidently work on software projects, knowing that they can safely explore new ideas, easily revert changes if needed, and collaborate effectively with their team, no matter where they are located.

## Chapter 2: The Evolution of Version Control

*From Stone Tablets to Digital Repositories*

The history of version control is fascinating. In ancient times, scribes used stone tablets to record information. If they made a mistake, they couldn't erase it but had to create a new tablet. Fast forward to the digital age, and version control has become an integral part of software development. It started with simple systems that saved different versions of files, but it has evolved into sophisticated tools that enable collaboration among developers worldwide.

With the advent of digital version control systems like Git, developers can now collaborate on software projects, share their knowledge, and contribute to the global coding community. Version control has become a powerful tool that allows developers to participate actively in the digital age and contribute to technological advancements.

## Chapter 3: The Need for Source Code Management (SCM)

*Keeping Your Code Safe and Sound*

<sup>Source code management (by securitypatterns.io)</sup>

Source Code Management (SCM) is a subset of version control. Think of your code as a recipe for a delicious dish. You want to keep that recipe safe and make improvements over time. SCM systems help you do just that. They ensure the security and integrity of your source code while allowing multiple developers to work on it simultaneously.

In the world of software development, source code is the heart of every application. It contains the instructions that make the program work. Without proper management, source code can become chaotic and difficult to maintain. SCM systems provide a structured approach to managing source code, allowing developers to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain the integrity of their codebase.

By using an SCM system like Git, developers can ensure the safety and security of their code, even when working on complex projects with multiple collaborators. With the ability to track changes, revert to previous versions, and merge code seamlessly, SCM systems empower developers to work together efficiently and produce high-quality software.

## Chapter 4: Collaborative Coding

*Working Together, Seamlessly*

Imagine building a skyscraper alone; it would take forever! In the coding world, collaboration is key. Collaboration in software development is made possible through version control systems like Git, Mercurial, etc. These systems enable developers to work together on the same codebase, making it easier to track changes, manage conflicts, and ensure that everyone is working on the most up-to-date version of the code. With the power of collaboration, developers can build amazing projects by leveraging the collective knowledge and skills of their team.

## Chapter 5: Real-World Applications

*From Software Development to Content Writing*

Version control and source code management are not exclusive to developers. Writers, designers, and even scientists use these tools to manage their projects. Virtually all modern collaborative software solutions like word processors (E.g. Google Docs, Microsoft Word, etc.), design tools, spreadsheets, etc. use some form of version control system under the hood to enable the users to keep track of changes and to collaborate more seamlessly.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

*Embrace the Power of Control*

In conclusion, version control and source code management are your best friends in the world of coding and beyond. They ensure the safety, collaboration, and organisation of your work. In the next article, we will dive into Git, we will look into Git platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab, and other topics to help you start your journey towards becoming a master of version control. Remember, version control and source code management are valuable skills that can enhance your coding journey, so embrace them with open arms. 

Happy coding!
