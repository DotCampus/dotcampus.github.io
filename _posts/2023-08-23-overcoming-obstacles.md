# Learning Software Development: How to Overcome Obstacles and Forge Ahead

If you're reading this from anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa, chances are you're familiar with someone who couldn't embark on a tech-learning journey due to the lack of a laptop, inadequate equipment, or the financial burden of internet costs. Many individuals start learning software development, only to drop out along the way, overwhelmed by the challenges. This pattern resonates deeply with me, as I've witnessed it among my peers when we embarked on our own tech journeys, and with many mentees I've guided. Today, this struggle is even more pronounced, fueled by the increasing number of people sliding into poverty each year, particularly in Nigeria.

For most people, the prospect of embarking on this journey might seem not just challenging, but nearly insurmountable. However, it doesn't have to be that way. With a mix of determination, strategic planning, a touch of luck, and the right mindset, anyone can step into the realm of software development and flourish, even in the face of limited resources.

### **1. Leveraging Mobile-friendly platforms, Libraries and Tech Hubs**

Not having access to a personal laptop shouldn't deter your aspirations. If you are able to read this, it means that you can still learn software development. There are many mobile friendly web platforms for coding, such as: **replit.com, codepen.io, jsbin.com, etc.** If you are into mobile apps, you could try **Sololearn**, **Grasshopper**, **Mimo**, etc. With these freely available tools, you can get started and go considerably far in your learning. Local computer centres, libraries and community tech hubs often provide access to computers, enabling you to delve into coding, development, and self-paced learning. These spaces foster an environment of learning and collaboration, opening doors to possibilities. So while your resources might be limited, as long as you are focused, your potential to learn and grow remains boundless.

### **2. Making the Most of Free/Affordable Internet**

Innovative minds find solutions, even when faced with financial constraints. If you're dealing with limited internet access during the day, consider making the most of free or more affordable internet options available during nighttime hours. In Nigeria, you can get as much as **450Â MB** at â‚¦**120** per day**.** Internet connections are typically better at night, so, you are sure to enjoy greater value for your money. Utilise this time to explore online tutorials, coding platforms, and educational resources. Consistency and dedication in your nighttime endeavours will lead you toward your software development goals.

### **3. Unlocking Scholarship Opportunities**

The tech community recognises the importance of diversity and inclusion. Many organisations, institutions, and tech giants offer scholarships for aspiring developers with limited means. These scholarships cover courses, coding boot-camps, and even degree programs. Explore these opportunities, if you feel that you may not be eligible. Do not write off yourself before you even get to try, and keep an eye out for application deadlines. A scholarship could be your passport to acquiring top-notch skills and education without the financial burden.

### **4. Harnessing Free and Affordable Resources**

The internet is a treasure trove of free and affordable resources that cater to aspiring developers. From online coding platforms like (Freecodecamp, Scrimba, Codecademy, etc) and YouTube tutorials to open-source projects and coding challenges, there's a wealth of knowledge waiting to be tapped. Immerse yourself in these resources, and focus on building a solid foundation in programming languages and development concepts.

### **5. Thriving on Community Support**

Never underestimate the power of community. Join online forums, tech-related social media groups, and coding communities. Bea active, engage in discussions, ask questions, and seek advice from experienced developers. The collective knowledge and support of these communities can provide invaluable insights, mentorship, and a sense of belonging on your journey.
