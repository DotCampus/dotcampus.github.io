Across industries – from Financial Services to Healthcare, Food, Construction, Beauty, and Retail – there is a growing need for skilled individuals with technology expertise. These professionals play a crucial role in building and expanding businesses' online presence. This demand has become even more apparent post-pandemic as companies recognize the importance of connecting their products and services with their target audience through the Internet and the World Wide Web. This article delves into my inspiring journey of transitioning from a non-technical background into the dynamic technology industry. It unravels personal experiences, challenges, and transformative insights that illuminate how one can not only overcome barriers but also excel in the exhilarating pursuit of a tech-focused career.

## The Hesitation: When Microbiology Meets Code
I studied Microbiology at the university. During my initial year of studies, I decided to acquire a marketable skill, driven by my desire for financial independence. Motivated by this, I signed up for a skills acquisition workshop organized by my department's student-faculty executives and chose the web development track. I was introduced to the realm of programming for the first time. I delved into the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other rudimentary concepts about the web. I was immediately captivated and began stoking aspirations of making it a full-time career. However, my initial enthusiasm was short-lived because while HTML and CSS were quite easy for me to grasp, I found the intricacies and more logical complexities of Javascript a bit more daunting. My confidence took a hit due to the difficulty I encountered in grasping numerous concepts during my learning journey. It was a strange experience for me to be struggling so much with learning something new. Doubt crept in and I concluded that if I was struggling this much, perhaps I was not suited for the task. This led me to make the difficult decision to relinquish my coding pursuits so I could focus on my academic commitments and maintain good grades. At least that is what I told myself. 

## Embracing the Journey: Rediscovering the Passion
Fast forward to my final year. I had a bit more time on my hands since the pandemic had caused my school to make the shift to holding lectures online. As graduation loomed, the necessity for financial independence became even more apparent. I connected with a friend who shared some invaluable resources that helped me start learning to code again. This time, however,  I resolved not to abandon my efforts. What made the pivotal difference? The difference was that this time, I had more tangible reasons that anchored me to persist, especially when facing the challenging moments that once drove me to quit.  Two pivotal factors played a role: the urgency stemming from financial constraints and a transformative book that reshaped my approach to learning. The book is called “Atomic Habits” by James Clear. What Mr. Clear emphasizes in his book is the monumental impact of consistent, modest endeavors that accumulate over time. He made me realize that I needed to shift my focus from the pursuit of perfection to embracing progress. So this time, I set up a study schedule. I would watch tutorials and practice coding for at least 2 hours every day regardless of the confusion or frustration I encountered. I did not give up, even when concepts appeared insurmountable. It was not easy but I persisted and I gradually saw my skills improve. Subsequently, I embarked on building projects that enriched my portfolio, which I then showcased to prospective employers. This journey culminated in securing my current position as a full-time remote developer.

## Overcoming the “Not for Me” Myth
Another hurdle I had to overcome was the belief that only a certain group of people could code. I was convinced at one point that coming from a biological sciences background completely disqualified me from being a programmer. That is a lie, a common one. The takeaway here is essential, especially for those who, like me, were once skeptics. With dedication, perseverance, a lot of hard work, and the right learning approach, anyone can excel in coding. It is crucial to understand that coding is within reach for anyone regardless of their academic origins. Do not be discouraged by initial challenges, they are a shared experience. You are not alone in these sentiments. Even people with computer science degrees confront difficulties. Persist steadfastly if coding aligns with your aspirations. Become comfortable with the fact that the learning never really ends.

## Guidance for Transitioning: Steps to Success
1. **Create a study schedule**: Carve out dedicated time to focus on learning this new skill and getting better at it.

2. **Do not get stuck in the tutorial loop**: Use platforms like [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) to get started on building real projects on your own. Try out your hands on the challenges and do not be scared of failure.

3. **Join a mentorship community**: Network and seek guidance from experienced professionals. Do not stay isolated as you learn.

## Conclusion: Your Tech Odyssey Begins
In summary, I encourage people who are just starting on their tech journey to do so with confidence. Focusing on progress over perfection, being consistent, and maintaining the right mindset is of utmost importance. Anyone can unlock the code to a rewarding tech career with dedication and determination. My tech journey has illuminated the potent truth that resilience and consistent effort can transform even the most challenging pursuits into personal victories.
