Whether you're aspiring to become a front-end developer, back-end engineer, or a full-stack engineer, or youâ€™re just exploring the subject, mastering the fundamental skills is your first step towards building impactful and user-friendly websites and consequently building a great career. In this post, I will show you the 10 essential technical skills needed for web development and explore some soft skills that will enhance your learning journey.

## Tech **Skills:**

1.  **Foundational Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, and Basic JavaScript**
    At the core of web development lies the trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures your web content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds visual appeal, and Basic JavaScript adds interactivity. Learning how these languages work together lays the groundwork for your web development endeavours.
2.  **Responsive Design**
    In a world where users access websites on various devices (E.g. PCs, tablets, mobile devices, etc.) responsive design is paramount. Acquiring the ability to craft websites that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes ensures an optimal user experience for your users/customers. When building responsive websites, follow a mobile-first approach.

3.  **Version Control/Git**
    Collaboration is a cornerstone of modern development. Git, a powerful version control system, empowers you to track changes, collaborate with others seamlessly, and maintain a clear history of your project's evolution. Git and GitHub are related, but are different things. GitHub is a hosting service for Git. Other hosting services include: Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.
4.  **Basic Web Hosting and Domains**
    It is one thing to know how to build your website, but if you cannot deploy it to the web, it may never see the light of the day. Bringing your website to life requires knowledge of web hosting and domains. Understanding how to publish your site on the internet and manage domains ensures your creations are accessible to the world.
5.  **Browser Developer Tools**
    Debugging and optimising your web pages are made easier with browser developer tools. Learning how to inspect, analyse, and modify your code directly in the browser empowers you to create polished and error-free websites. Chrome and Firefox browsers both have robust developer tools.
6.  **Web Accessibility**
    Inclusivity is key in the digital age. About 2.2 billion people are visually impaired worldwide, learning about web accessibility ensures your websites are usable by all individuals, including those with visual impairment (including blindness) and other disabilities. Building with accessibility in mind reflects a commitment to creating an internet that's open to everyone.
7.  **Problem-Solving and Documentation**
    Web development often involves overcoming challenges and creative. Cultivating problem-solving skills fosters a growth mindset. This can be done by solving more problems (especially algorithm and data-structure problems). Also, clear documentation helps you understand your codebase and assists others who may collaborate with you. A combination of problem-solving and documentation skills ensures the longevity of your works and aids your development journey.
8.  **Web Security Fundamentals**
    As you create interactive and data-driven web applications, understanding basic web security is crucial. Protecting your users' data and safeguarding your applications from potential threats is your responsibility as a developer, and it should be taken very seriously. You do not need to be a Cyber Security expert, the knowledge of O.W.A.S.P. Top Ten risks and how to guard against them should suffice.
9.  **Basic SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)**
    Ensuring that it is discoverable by search engines is just as important as creating and hosting it. Search engine optimisation enables you to capture organic leads from search engines without having to pay for it. A grasp of basic SEO principles helps improve your website's visibility on search engines, making it easier for users to find your content.
10. **Command Line Basics**
    Command line proficiency may seem daunting, but it's an invaluable skill for efficient development. Navigating directories, running scripts, and interacting with development tools become smoother when you're comfortable with the command line.

2. **Effective Communication**
   Clear communication is vital when collaborating with team members, clients, or users. Being able to explain your ideas, give and receive feedback, and present your work is a valuable skill. I strongly recommend this skill as it is often the difference between a successful developer and a failure.
3. **Professionalism**
   Developing a professional demeanour, meeting deadlines, managing expectations, communicating delays, and exhibiting a positive attitude to what you do contribute to a successful and fulfilling career in web development and beyond.
4. **Resume Writing and Portfolio Building**
   Web development market is very competitive and is even more competitive as more people enter the market. If you are unable to show off your skills to a potential employer or client, then you are just a hobbyist in this space. Crafting an impressive resume and showcasing your work in a portfolio can set you apart in a competitive job market. Learn how to highlight your skills, projects, and achievements effectively.
5. **Continuous Learning and Adaptability**
   The tech industry is ever-evolving. Embracing a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability ensures you stay relevant and open to new opportunities.

It may seem daunting at first, but with time everything will start to fall into place. Strive for a balance between technical prowess and soft skills to unlock your full potential in the dynamic world of web development and beyond. Your journey is just beginning, and with dedication and patience, you'll create remarkable digital experiences and excel in your professional endeavours.
