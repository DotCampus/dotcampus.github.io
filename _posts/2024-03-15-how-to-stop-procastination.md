Ever feel like you just don't have enough time? Maybe you do, and you're just a master procrastinator. Don't worry, you're not alone! Procrastination is a struggle for many of us. 

## What is Procrastination?

It's putting things off until the very last minute. While it might give you a temporary relieve, it leads to stress, anxiety, and even poor quality work in the long run. 

## Why Do We Procrastinate?

There are many reasons, but here are a few common ones:

- **The Task Feels Overwhelming:** A giant project can be paralyzing. The thoughts of having so much to do is a major cause of being overwhelmed 

- **The Task Seems Boring:** When you don't find the task interesting, there are chances you'll keep pushing it back. Break up your tasks and make it more interesting.

**Perfectionism:** You want it to be flawless and by doing so, you'll never start. Remember, progress is better than perfection!

## Tips to Beat Procrastination:

**Break it Down:** Big tasks become less scary when you see them as a series of small, achievable steps. Even a big mountain can be climbed one step at a time. Break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable size that way they'll be less scary and you'll be less anxious.

- **Set Realistic Goals:** Don't overload your schedule. Be honest about what you can accomplish in a set time frame. Work with your schedule and set achievable goals. You're already busy, don't write down 10 task to achieve in 3 hours.

- **Find Your Focus Zone:** When are you most productive? Some people work best in the morning, while others get better results at night. Identify when you're most productive and schedule your toughest tasks for that time.

- **Reward Yourself:** Reward yourself with breaks or gifts when you finish your tasks.

- **Find an Accountability Partner:** Getting someone to hold you accountable can be a great motivator to complete your scheduled tasks. A friend, colleague, or online community can keep you motivated. 

Remember, progress over perfection! By implementing these tips, you can reduce your level of procrastinating and achieve your goals.
