If you are like some people, you may also be asking: Will I become an expert after 3 months of learning a tech skill? The short answer is no, you cannot. Do not let anybody fool you. Many things go into becoming an expert in programming and tech in general. 3 or 6 months of intensive learning will get you many steps closer, but would not get you there. You will need to do more.

In this article, I will guide you through the steps you need to take to become an expert in tech. I will draw from my own experiences in learning software development, as well as teaching and mentoring others in the field for the past 5 years. Additionally, I will share insights and qualities that distinguish those who succeed in the tech industry from those who don't.

### 1. Choose the Right Path

This is where you answer the question, what am I interested in learning in tech and why? You need to get this step right. without finding out what you need to learn and why, you may start floating around without direction and a little challenge would be enough to derail you from your learning. By August 2024, we (Dot Campus) will include a recommendation system that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help people choose what is best for them to learn with us on our website.

### 2. Follow a Structured Learning Curriculum

After choosing the right path that makes sense to you, the next step is to find and utilize a well-structured learning curriculum. You know a well-structured curriculum if it meets you at your current skill level and gradually takes you to where you ought to be. For example, if you have decided to learn Python for backend development and you have zero coding experience, a good curriculum would start from an introduction to computer science and programming, fundamentals of web development, Git, etc. and take you up gradually until you are ready for Python. If you jump into Python, without these, you may jump out the same way you entered without achieving mastery.

### 3. Practice More Than You Study

A common error that people make in learning a tech skill is to approach the learning like they’re learning a course at the university. It is okay to study, but studying alone will not get you there.  Practice is the best way to learn any tech skill. If you study 1 hour a day, ensure that you practice 2 or 3 times more. Find hands-on and real-world projects to practice with. Collaborate with people to build stuff and learn from them. That’s how to develop expertise.

### 4. 500 - 1000 Hours of Practice

Borrowing from the “10,000 hours rule for mastery”, you need an average of 750 hours of practice to become job-ready in most tech skills today, especially software development. This means that if you practice 10 hours a week, you will need about 12 to 18 months to become fully job-ready. If you practice 20 hours a week, you will need about 6 - 9 months to become job-ready. The more you give the better you get and the quicker you can achieve mastery of the tech skills. With this in mind, consistency would be your winning ticket. If you can follow through consistently, then you should be in a good place before you even know it.

### 5. Do You Have a Mentor?

An experienced mentor in the chosen field is what Moses was to the Israelites. A mentor knows where you are going and everything you need to get there because they have walked the same path and they succeeded. This is why they are so important. They will help you avoid common errors that people make, introduce you to best practices early in your learning and encourage you when you need it the most. Make sure to find one if you are learning for a career or job.

### 6. Network With People Who are on the Same Quest

Do not learn in isolation. Meet people who have the same mission as yourself and learn from them. You will get there faster together. 

### 7. Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept…

**…Is to become a life-long learner.** Even after reaching the 750 hours required for job readiness or the 10,000 hours required for mastery, your mission remains the same: continuous learning and improvement. You must be prepared to be a lifelong learner, embracing change. No, It's not a mission impossible. You have to embrace the constant change that flows through the tech world.

Just two years ago, we didn't have to learn about AI, but now AI is permeating every aspect of tech and you have to learn it to keep up. If you don't, you could quickly lose your "expert" title, if you have already earned it.

### Conclusion

Reading this far is proof that you are committed to this cause and willing to learn all it takes to become an expert. This is the final step/lesson: **commitment**. Stay committed to the process. Seize every opportunity that you can find. Contribute to open-source and community projects to grow your skills, network with professionals, keep up with the trends and stay connected with the experts. Get a mentor and embrace lifelong learning.

I will see you soon at the top!
