# “I Tried Learning Tech on My Own but I Didn’t Go Very Far” —  A Conversation With a FATE Scholar at Dot Campus.

**Bash:** Hi Hi, good to have you with us. 

**Fortune:** Hi Bash, Hi Judith. Good to be here.Thank you for inviting me. 

**Bash:** You’re welcome. 

Okayy…let’s get started…Please tell us your name and what course you’re currently learning at Dot Campus.  

**Fortune:** Yeah…My name is Fortune Uchegbu and I am currently learning Front End Engineering here at Dot Campus. 

**Judith:** Interesting…and thank you. Can you tell us a bit about yourself—Who is Fortune Outside Front-End Engineering and Tech in general. 

**Fortune:** Okayyy…outside of tech, I’m a second-year undergraduate of UNILAG (University of Lagos). I’m studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering and I’m also a worker at the Church fellowship I attend in school. Additionally, I am a recipient of the inaugural FATE Scholar(ship) program run by FATE foundation. Interestingly, I am the last born in a wonderful family and I’ve had a fun and lovely childhood growing up in Lagos state.

**Judith:** Nice… That’s some really cool profile. 

Errm… you’re studying Electrical Engineering…So I’d like to know - What inspired you to start learning Front-End, and why now?   

**Fortune:**  Okay. 

Actually, my journey into Front-End Engineering(and tech in general) wasn’t exactly intentional. Since I was little, I’ve always had this desire to know how things work, but I didn’t really know much about tech until a friend of mine at a tutorial back then, who knew more about it, introduced me to HTML and CSS. I wrote my first “Hello world” and it got really interesting after that. The thrill of finding that I could make a change on the browser from my little editor space.   
  
As for why now, I’d say, it’s a high-growth industry that provides the platform to create and solve actual problems in the society, plus – I enjoy it.
  
**Bash:** Hmmm…when you say high growth, do you really mean the moneyyyyyy or…?

**Fortune:** Haha…😀😅Oh yeah…. The money, the progression. All of it all. 

**Bash:** *(Smiles)*...More like it.

**Judith:** Have you ever tried learning a tech course before Dot campus—What was your experience like and how is it different this time?   
  
**Fortune:** Yes, I have. 

After I wrote my first “Hello World” and got really interested, I tried learning on my own, using YouTube and anything I could get my hands on, but I didn’t go very far because I didn’t have a clue on what and how exactly to learn. I was later mentored for a period by a church member who was a senior software engineer, but that also ended.   


Dot Campus came at a very crucial time. I had gotten flexible with HTML and CSS and had just begun learning JavaScript and didn’t know the best order to go about it. The course outline, which is really very detailed, helped me structure my learning unlike I had ever done before.

**Judith:** Great…We like to hear that. 

What has been your favorite part of the course so far — and why?   

**Fortune:** Ahh😅, that’s quite easy for now. So far, it has been JavaScript. You see, while I was still learning HTML and CSS, I unconsciously developed a low-key fear of js, cause whenever I randomly inspected some website’s code or peeked into it to wet my hands, I was usually lost with all the js😂. Anyway, I later got to know they were mostly frameworks so when I began working on projects that used vanilla Js (no frameworks) and saw that I was getting it, it felt so good. Yes, there were ups and downs with those bugs that never came out clean, but I always enjoyed it, especially the logical aspects of it.   
  
Currently, I’m combining React (a js framework) with Data structures and Algorithms, and I think I’ll be having more favorites onboarding very soon...*(eyeing testing and design topics👀)*   


**Judith:**  That’s a whole lot and we’re glad you’re finding it fun. 

**Bash:** Could you share a small ‘win’ or moment that made you feel proud recently, no matter how simple.  
  
**Fortune:**  Hmm, my most recent would be when I was able to get the react welcome page hosted for the first time. I’ve been wanting to move into the framework for a while now soo…yeah, that’s a small win for me✨. Indeed it is!

**Bash:** What’s a topic or concept that really stretched you?  How did you handle it?   
  
**Fortune:**  *(*Sighs in aki and paw paw😩)* - It was the CRUD concept, meaning Create, Reply, Update and Delete. 

**Bash:**  *(cuts in)* Oh yeah… we know that😅

*(Bash and Judith exchanging glances of “at least we know this one”)*

**Fortune:**  Okay 😅😅

It’s about incorporating these functionalities into any product. It really pushed me because I had never worked on any project like that prior to the one that made me learn it - an interactive comments section project on my learning board. So, it was my first time handling everything dynamically from user input to comment or reply creation, editing or deleting to storage handling.  
 
I was able to handle it by researching, unlearning and relearning. I also used all resources at my disposal – YouTube, ai, articles and so on, this time not vain searching but specifically looking for the right info since I already had a learning guide. 

**Judith:**  Cool. 

What’s one thing you now understand about tech that you didn’t before starting?  


**Fortune:** Hmm, it would be finding that tech is a real opportunity to solve problems with technology. More than having a career, is the fact that I can solve the problems around me, no matter how little.  

**Bash:** Osheyyy…Agba problem solver

**Fortune:** Haha 😅😅😅 thank you, thank you.

**Judith:** 😊 So…If someone is just starting out like you, what’s one piece of advice you'd give them?   
  
It would be to try their hands on as many things as they can, find their niche, and learn it well. Don’t be afraid to try out as much as possible. Once you’ve found something that calls you, do it and do it well. 

**Bash:** Such a million dollar advice. 

**Judith:** I hope someone is listening

**Fortune:** 😁😁

**Judith:** What would you say to your ‘past self’ the day before starting this course?   

**Fortune:** It’s worth it💚.  

**Judith:** We couldn't agree less. It is indeed worth it.

**Bash:**  So Fortune, how has being a part of the Dot Campus community helped or shaped your journey so far?  
   
**Fortune:** Hmmm…

The Dot Campus community has been a real source of encouragement for me, especially in times when I’d doubt if I can actually do this and land a job, but seeing people, just like me, actively learning and growing would leave me pumped and ready to continue learning. 

**Bash:**  Rightttttt?

Is there any favorite part of the Live Retro sessions?  What stood out to you?   
  
**Fortune:** Hmmm, my favorite part of the weekly learner’s Retro sessions should be the interactive parts where everyone shares their insights on a topic. I usually get to learn a lot from the perspectives of others.  

**Bash:** We should do this often. *(Bash and Judith in looks of satisfaction and accomplishment)*

Thank you for that, Fortune.

**Bash:**  What’s one thing you’re looking forward to learning or doing next in your course?  


**Fortune:** I’m looking forward to learning the Design and Testing topics, but what I’ll be doing next would be to go deeper in React and DSA

**Bash:** Nice. If you could describe your future tech self in three words, what would they be? 


**Fortune:** Curious, Innovative, Experienced 

**Judith:** Interesting. Now to our last question.

Just in case someone is looking for a junior engineer like you. What kind of projects would you love to work on one day — even if it feels far off right now? 


**Fortune:** Hmm, I'd one day love to work on the sort of apps that are widely used daily throughout the world. From social media to games to fintech apps and AI applications too. Not to just be restricted to websites but to be able to work across diverse platforms. 

I pray the someone sees this 🙏🏻

**Judith:** Of course they will. You’re a worker in the church fellowship na. Abi you don’t have faith in God? 😂😂

**Fortune:** Oh yes. I have faith oo. 😅

**Judith:** 😅😅 Alright.

That’ll be all for this conversation. It was really great getting to know and learn about you…and your interests. 

……………………………

**Bash:** Don’t stop learning and thank you once again for coming!

**Fortune:**  Thank you too. I really do appreciate this and thank you to Dot Campus.
