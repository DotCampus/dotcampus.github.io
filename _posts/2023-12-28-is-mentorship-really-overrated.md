# Is Mentorship Really Overrated?

![Mentorship?](https://github.com/DotCampus/dotcampus.github.io/assets/31534129/052c184e-ac6c-43b5-9997-232404d7cc77)

Sometimes we use the term "overrated" to describe something that didn't live up to our expectations. For instance, remember the pressure you felt to try a pizza slice for the first time? Or when you couldn't wait to watch a popular movie or TV series? Or when you saved up for the latest gadget, thinking it would solve all of your problems? But what was your experience like after you tried them? If you felt disappointed and thought, *"Oops, it's not that great,"* or *"I could do without it,"* then you likely overrated it.

Similarly, some people think that mentorship is overrated because they've had negative experiences with it, or they haven't had any experiences with it at all. There are several reasons why people might feel this way, which I'll list below.

- **Lack of Role Models/Beneficiaries of Mentorship** - Only in religious matters do we believe without seeing. No one truly agrees to a thing until they are a witness or direct beneficiary of it. If you don’t know someone in your circle/immediate surroundings who has benefited from mentorship, how would you speak highly of it?
- **Lack of Awareness**: People don’t really understand what mentorship is and the impact it can have in their lives. Truly, is there anyone who values what they do not know about?
- **Independence Bias**: The tendency to attach success to self alone is the reason why many undervalue mentorship. “I’m self-reliant”…, “I’m Independent”.., “I can do it”…, and all those affirmations we read out to ourselves may be doing more harm than good. When we reach out for assistance, we show even more strength in the acknowledgement of our situations.
- **Perceived Time Investment**: If you’re one of those who think that mentorship demands 70% of your time, you may be one to have overrated it. While time is important in a mentor-mentee relationship, it should be seen as an investment in future success, not an obstacle.
- **Fear of Vulnerability**: Being a mentee often involves opening up, admitting weaknesses, and being vulnerable. Some fear this level of openness and it hinders their willingness to seek or value mentorship.
- **Mismatched Expectations**: Mentorship is overrated to many because of the unrealistic expectations from the relationship. A mentor is not the same as a coach or a sponsor. A mentor is a mentor only. If we understand this, our mentorship experience will yield better results.
- **Short-Term Focus**: Sadly, quick results are becoming the order of the day. Short-term results are now more prioritised over long-term growth. If we understand that not everyone will get a Job, make six (or seven) figure income, or elevate their lifestyle (whatever this means to you) in the first few months of mentorship, we would better value it.
- **Limited Resources**: Individuals and organisations who organise mentorships do not account for personality differences and so the quality of mentorship received is little or nothing to write home about. Conducive environments, proper mentee-mentor matching, and sufficient support are some of what make an excellent mentorship relationship.

Despite all of these, the value of mentorship is widely recognised in many successful individuals' journeys and can not be taken away. It is our combined duty to raise awareness about the benefits of mentorship and create a culture that values these relationships because if we do, Mentorship will no longer be overrated.
