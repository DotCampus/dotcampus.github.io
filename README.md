# Welcome to Dot Campus Blog

This blog shares knowledge, tips and experience regarding software development and tech in general. The blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). GitHub Pages uses a software called “Jekyll”. Jekyll is what converts the markdown blog post files into nicely formatted HTML that you can view in the browser.

## Contributing Blog Content

Blog posts are stored in the _posts folder in `.md` format. Preview the existing blog posts to get an idea of how to structure it.

 - Blog post files should always be named using this format: `yyyy-mm-dd-your-blog-post-name.md`

 - A post written on August 24th, 2023, would be named `2023-08-24-my-blog-post.md`. Do not use future dates because the post won’t show up.

 - Posts are written in markdown.

 - You can create a blog post from your browser on GitHub.

That’s about all you need to know to get started.
